# React Admin Dashboard App

The Admin Panel includes one Dashboard, three pages, four Apps and seven fully functional charts to explore the different possibilities of application that can be made.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]


The Project is  created using React and integrated with Syncfusion component library. I used context API for statemanagement since it is a relatively small application. For styling Talwind CSS is used as it the components can be designed on the go. Here React Router DOM is used which is a popular routing library for React applications, enabling client-side routing and navigation.
It's used to define and manage routes within the application, allowing users to navigate between different pages or views.React Icons library is used to enhance the visual appeal of the application by incorporating icons into UI components.

Syncfusion Integration:
Syncfusion, a comprehensive UI component suite, is integrated into the dashboard project.
Syncfusion components offer a wide range of functionalities and features, allowing developers to build complex interfaces efficiently.
The free community license provided by Syncfusion enables developers to access and utilize the entire suite of components without additional cost.
